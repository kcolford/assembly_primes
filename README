This project is a prime number generator written entirely in assembly
for the linux kernel running on the x86_64.

What's interesting about this program is that even though the
theoretical complexity of the order O(N * sqrt(N)), because it uses a
prime number sieve, the benchmarks show it having a linear runtime.
